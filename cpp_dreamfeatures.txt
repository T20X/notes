(1) reverse for loops for STL containers
(2) list to have reserve as well!
//(3) algorithms to accept reverse iterators
(4) ability to set lambda in the class - Atm cannot do the below!
MyClass o([](const auto& v) { std::cout << v << std::endl; })
(5) two argument constructor for constexpr atomic( T desired ) noexcept;
to allow spicfy memory model on initialization write to atomic in order to be sure
it would have been synchronized
(6) powerfull stringstream. the current implmenentation are limited. cannot re-use the buffer / pre-allocate!
