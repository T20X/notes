The overloads that do not use std::piecewise_construct_t assume that each tuple argument becomes the element of a pair. The overloads that use std::piecewise_construct_t assume that each tuple argument is used to construct, piecewise, a new object of specified type, which will become the element of the pair
------------------------
std::forward_as_tuple
std::tie - Creates a tuple of lvalue references to its arguments or instances of std::ignore.

const Fred& operator[] (unsigned index) const;  // Subscript operators often come in pairs
  Fred&       operator[] (unsigned index);        // Subscript operators often come in pai
----------
Sometimes it's safe to throw an exception even while std::uncaught_exception() == true. For example, if stack unwinding causes an object to be destructed, the destructor for that object could run code that throws an exception as long as the exception is caught by some catch block before escaping the destructor.

template <typename... Args>
void print_size(Args... args)
{
  cout << sizeof...(args) << endl;
}

int main(void)
{
  print_size(); // outputs 0
  print_size("Is the answer", 42, true); // outputs 3
}

lambdas diffrences between C++11 and C++14
-------------
In C++14 all of these possible.

Move example:

auto f1 = [v = std::move(v)](auto arg) { f(42, arg, std::move(v)); };
Expression example:

auto f1 = [sum = a + b](auto arg) { f(42, arg, sum); };
See question

Perfect forwarding: You can write

auto f1 = [=](auto&& arg) { f(42, std::forward<decltype(arg)>(arg)); };

----------------
copy elision
(RVO, no copy/move of thrown/catch objects if they have no-sideeffects)

----------------
move semantics
--------------
(1) const objects cannot be moved, copy construct will be called
(2) only one of these functions can be declared
    void f(Base other)
    void f(Base&& other)
(3) Remember that “&&” indicates a universal reference only where type deduction takes place

universal ref: ->
template<typename T>
void f(T&& param); 

not universal ref ->
template<typename T>
void f(vector<T>&& param); 

Universal references can only occur in the form “T&&”!  Even the simple addition of a const qualifier is enough to disable the interpretation of “&&” as a universal referenc
 
(4)  && has preference when taking a temporary Base() as input, then template<T>(T&&), then const Base&! coz overloading has a precedence over templates!
    void f(const Base& other) 
    void f(Base&& other) 
    template <typename T> void f(T&& other) {}
    void f(const Base&& other)

(5) C++ does not guarantee any order for the evaluation of function arguments

(6) exception is a virtual class


(7) The lifetime of the temporary may be extended by binding a reference to it (in which case its lifetime is extended until the end of the lifetime of the reference), or by using it as an initializer in a constructor's initializer list (in which case its lifetime is extended until the object being constructed is fully constructed).

Temporary objects are destroyed as the last step in evaluating the full-expression (1.9) that (lexically) contains the point where they were created. This is true even if that evaluation ends in throwing an exception
