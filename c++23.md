# std::flat_<containers>

Some advantages of flat set over other standard associative containers are:

Potentially faster lookup (even though search operations have logarithmic complexity).
Much faster iteration: random access iterators instead of bidirectional iterators.
Less memory consumption for small objects (and for big objects if KeyContainer::shrink_to_fit() is available).
Better cache performance (depending on KeyContainer, keys are stored in a contiguous block(s) of memory).
Some disadvantages of flat set are:

Non-stable iterators (iterators are invalidated when inserting and erasing elements).
Non-copyable and non-movable type values can not be stored.
Weaker exception safety (copy/move constructors can throw when shifting values in erasures and insertions).
Slower (i.e. linear) insertion and erasure, especially for non-movable types.
