1. function call can prevent the compiler from re-ordering staff around it as it cannot know what the function is doing...

2.  // RECURSIVE TAIL OPTIMIZATION
template <typename FilterFunction, typename Iterator>
std::vector<std::string> names_for(
        Iterator people_begin,
        Iterator people_end,
        FilterFunction filter)
{
    return names_for_helper(people_begin,
                            people_end,
                            filter,
                            {});
}

In this case, compilers that support tail-call optimization (TCO) will be able to convert 
the recursive function to a simple loop
