Verbs can be considered to be either action verbs or state verbs. Action verbs, are the verbs used to convey an action, eg run, jump, dance, fight, etc. State verbs, however, usually do not convey an action but they convey information about our ideas, thoughts, feelings and existence, eg think, feel (as in emotion, not as in touching), know, believe, be or have

PRESENT CONTINUOUS VS PRESENT simple
----------------
State verbs are rarely used in the continuous tense. Action verbs are often used in this tense. This is because the continuous indicates that something is happening now (although it may have commenced in the past), and will probably cease at some stage in the future. So, it contains an implied message that whatever is being done is temporary. This is reasonable for action verbs; in the absence of perpetual motion, we expect most actions to cease at some stag
normally you won't use those verbs with present continuous

states (know, understand, remember, etc.),
general realities (belong, fit, contain, consist, seem, etc.),
emotions and wishes (like, love, hate, etc.)

though I'm considering (to think carefully about something) always is used with present continous

words to really avoid with present continous  - know,believe,own,consist of,agree,conclude,,prefer,doubht

to emphezaie temporary events or that you started recently something new present continous is used often with
understand, suggest, love, sound,attrackt,likelook,find,realize,regret,think,understand


storry telling normally starts with present simple, but long events are introduced with continuous
