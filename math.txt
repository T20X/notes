312(numerator)/941(denominator)

log x A = y; x = base, A - fixed number, y - exponent!
log x(a * b) = log x (a) + log x (b)

sum of arithmertic progression -> n*(a+b)/2 
n - number ofelemetns to sum, a - start, b - end

sum of geometric progression ->
(bk - a) / (k -1)

rational number a/b - where a and b are integers

polynomial time complexity - O(n^k) where k is CONSTANT!
O(n!) - permutational time complexity!

2^N - number of sets! (say {1,2,3} and {3,2,1} are the same } including empty set!
 -  If we just want to select K subelemts then, it is n!/k!(n - k)!
n! - numer of all permutations!
 -  If we just want to select K subelemts then, it is n!/(n - k)!
