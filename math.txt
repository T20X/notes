log x A = y; x = base, A - fixed number, y - exponent!
log x(a * b) = log x (a) + log x (b)

sum of arithmertic progression -> n*(a+b)/2 
n - number ofelemetns to sum, a - start, b - end

sum of geometric progression ->
(bk - a) / (k -1)

rational number a/b - where a and b are integers

negatrion - ~

equivalance - =

polynomial time complexity - O(n^k) where k is CONSTANT!
O(n!) - permutational time complexity!

2^N - number of sets! (say {1,2,3} and {3,2,1} are the same } including empty set!
 -  If we just want to select K subelemts then, it is n!/k!(n - k)!
n! - numer of all permutations!
 -  If we just want to select K subelemts then, it is n!/(n - k)!

triangular numbers are the sum of the first n positive integers

Pythagoreans also observed that some numbers could not be made into any nontrivial rectangular shape (a shape where both sides of the rectangle are greater than 1). These are what we now call prime numbers - numbers that are not products of smaller numbers

The product of two odd numbers is an odd number
