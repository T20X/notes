(1) vector::push_back
"If T's move constructor is not noexcept and T is not CopyInsertable into *this, 
vector will use the throwing move constructor. If it throws, 
the guarantee is waived and the effects are unspecified."

move_if_noexcept - can still move even move throwing move constructor,
 if copy constructor is not available!

(2)
If the new size() is greater than capacity() then all 
iterators and references (including the past-the-end iterator)
 are invalidated. Otherwise only the past-the-end iterator is invalidated
