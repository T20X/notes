# reference_wrapper

now can contains incomplete types !

# ranges

object which contains begin() and end(). They don't replace iterators,but enchance them!

## sentinels

end() in a range is not necesserialy must be of the same iterator type as begin! it could be any type that got a comparison operator defined

unreachable_sentinel_t is used for optimization to ensure that any comparions would return false so that one can you use range algo which WOULD NEVER REACH the END and "iterator" with end() comparison could be optimized out!

std::ranges::find(s, std::unreachable_sentinel, CharT{})

## common ranges

you can make container out of them!

```
std::vector v(std::ranges::begin(r), std::ranges::end(r));
```
There are the STL containers, for which begin() and end() both return iterators of the same type. We call such a range a “common range”. If r is a common range, the above code will work.

## convert range to standard container

* you can make container out of them!

```
std::vector v(std::ranges::begin(r), std::ranges::end(r));
```
There are the STL containers, for which begin() and end() both return iterators of the same type. We call such a range a “common range”. If r is a common range, the above code will work.



 * However, for all the new C++20 views, begin() returns an iterator and end() returns a sentinel. In general, those are different types. If you give the constructor of std::vector an iterator pair where the types don’t match, it will be all confused and fail to compile.

At first, it might look like we can fix this. There is a view in C++20 that lets you convert a non-common range into a common range. It’s called the common view. The adapter std::views::common returns the common view of a range, if it is not a common range already, and the all view of the range otherwise:

auto common = std::views::common(r);
auto v = std::vector(std::ranges::begin(common), std::ranges::end(common));
Unfortunately, this still doesn’t work for all ranges. Ranges with non-copyable iterators, such as std::ranges::basic_istream_view, cannot be converted to a common range (this is a constraint of common_view). In this case, this approach doesn’t work at all.



* Last resort which would finally work

So let’s try another approach. We can default-initialise the container first (which means you won’t get to benefit from CTAD), and then you explicitly copy the elements of the range across:

```
std::vector<my_type> v;
std::ranges::copy(r, std::back_inserter(v));
```


* Another summary of this issue which would be formally addressed in C++23


## projections

projection is a unary callable that is accepted by the most algorithms. projections modify the view of the data that projection sees. They are invocable really so you can pass pointers to memebers and pointers to member functions!

IMPORTANT: sometimes passing lambdas may be faster than passing pointers to memebers / functions, just because compliers more effectively inline lambads!

## views

enable to create ranges using lazy evaluation and don't create exessive copying / moves!

### iconic example

```
auto square = [](auto i) { return i* i;};
auto is_even = [](auto i) { return i % 2 == 0;};

auto view = vec | view::filter(is_even)
                | view::transform(square);

reanges::copy(view, ostream_iterator<int>{cout});
```

## examples

```
  std::ranges::for_each(v, [](auto v) {}, &Employe::id);
```


```
std::ranges::sort(employes, {}/*ranges_less by default*/, &Empliyed::id)
std::ranges::sort(paycheck, {}/*ranges_less by default*/, &Paycheck::id)
std::ranges::equalt_to(emplolyes, paycheck, {}/*ranges_equal by default*/, &Empliyed::id, &Paycheck::id)
```

# concepts

 * Non-formal definition -> Concept allows us to control the instantiation of templates by testing syntactic conditions, but testing syntactic conditions. SFINAE on steroids

 * A concept is a named set of requirements.The definition of a   concept must appear at namespace scope   concepts are like compile time predicate
  and farily the same can be said about constraints,  but concepts emobyd semantics(meaning).
  Each concept is a predicate, evaluated at compile time, and becomes a part of the interface of a template where it is used as a constraint.

 * Violations of constraints are detected at compile time, early in the template instantiation process,
  which leads to easy to follow error message. The intent of concepts is to model semantic categories(Number, Range, RegularFunction)
   rather than syntactic restrictions(HasPlus, Array) - The ability to specify a
    meaningful semantics is a defining characteristic of a true concept,
    as opposed to a syntactic constrain

    Say Sorteable is concept,
    but constraint is say Subtractable,
    Incrementable

    // Concepts cannot recursively refer to themselves and cannot be constrained
    template <class T, class U>
    concept Derived = std::is_base_of<U, T>::value;
template <typename T>
concept Hashable = requires(T a) {
  { std::hash<T>{}(a) } -> std::convertible_to<std::size_t>;
};

template <C1 T>
concept Error1 = true; // Error: C1 T attempts to constrain a concept definition
template <class T>
requires C1<T>
concept Error2 =
    true; // Error: the requires-clause attempts to constrain a concept

Explicit instantiations, explicit specializations,
    or partial specializations of concepts
                are not allowed(the meaning of the original definition of a
                                    constraint cannot be changed)
                    .

            ................

            The keyword requires is used to introduce a requires -
            clause,
    which specifies constraints on template arguments or
        on a function declaration

            the keyword requires must be followed by some constant
            expression(so its possible to write requires true), but the intent is that a named concept (as in the example above) or a conjunction/disjunction of named concepts or a requires-expression is used



 * Concepts can be part of template
```
  template <Addable T>
  void f(const T& t) {  
  }
```

 * Concepts can be just used with auto
```
auto f(Addable cont auto const& v) {
}
```

* Concep can be just defined as simple exprssions as well
```
 template< class T, class... Args >
concept constructible_from =
    std::destructible<T> && std::is_constructible_v<T, Args...>;
```

* Concept can be composed in a pretty complicated way
```        
template< class I >
    concept bidirectional_iterator =
        std::forward_iterator<I> &&
        std::derived_from</*ITER_CONCEPT*/<I>, std::bidirectional_iterator_tag> &&
        requires(I i) {
            { --i } -> std::same_as<I&>;
            { i-- } -> std::same_as<I>;
        };
```

## constraint 

 constraint is a sequence of logical operations and operands that specifies requirements on template arguments. They can appear within requires-expressions (see below) and directly as bodies of concepts.
There are three types of constraints:

1) conjunctions
2) disjunctions
3) atomic constraints

The keyword requires is used to introduce a requires-clause, which specifies constraints on template arguments or on a function declaration
template<class T>
void g(T) requires is_purrable<T>(); // error, is_purrable<T>() is not a primary expression
template <class T> void h(T) requires(is_purrable<T>()); // OK

The keyword requires is also used to begin a requires - expression,
which is a prvalue expression of type bool that describes the constraints on
some template arguments.Such an expression is true if the constraints are satisfied,and false otherwise

```
 template <typename T>
    concept Addable = requires(T x) {
  x + x;
}; // requires-expression
```

template <typename T>
requires Addable<T> // requires-clause, not requires-expression
    T add(T a, T b) {
  return a + b;
}

template <typename T>
requires requires(T x) { x + x; } // ad-hoc constraint, note keyword used twice
T add(T a, T b) { return a + b; }

Concepts works really well with lambdas !template <class T>
concept Number = std::is_integer<T>::value;
auto f = [](Number n)

    // infamous `requires requires`. First `requires` is requires-clause,
    // second one is requires-expression. Useful if you don't want to introduce
    // new concept.
    template <typename T>
requires requires(T a, T b) { a + b; }
auto f4(T x)


...............

 For parameter packs, MyConcept... Ts requires MyConcept to be true for each element of the pack, not for the whole pack at once, e.g. requires<T1> && requires<T2> && ... && requires<TLast>.


 ..............
 Contstrains can be used for function overload basically, but one thing is important to note
 
 It’s important to understand how the compiler decomposes constraints and when it can see that they have common atomic constraint and deduce order between them. During decomposition, the concept name is replaced with its definition but requires-expression is not further decomposed. Two atomic constraints are identical only if they are represented by the same expression at the same location. For example, concept C = C1 && C2 is decomposed to conjunction of C1 and C2 but concept C = requires{
  ...
} becomes concept C = Expression-Location-Pair and its body is not further decomposed. If two concepts have common or even the same requirements in their requires-expression, they will always be unordered because either their requires-expressions are not equal or they are equal but at different source locations. The same happens with duplicated usage of a naked type traits - they always represent different atomic constraints because of different locations, thus, cannot be used for orderin

void f(std::integral auto){}        // #1
void f(integral_or_floating auto) {} // #2
void f(std::same_as<char> auto) {}   // #3

// calls #1 because std::integral is more constrained
// than integral_or_floating(#2)
f(int{});

(4) C++ 17 didn’t allow to move rvalue references in return statements,
    function parameters in throw expressions,
    and various forms of conversions unreasonably prevented moving

    (5) std::launder is
    not requried anymore as const andr ref now can be repalced in placement new

    (5) c++ 20 now allows you to do this;
->unofficially called direct aggregate initialization

    struct A {
  int i;
  int b;
};

A a(1, 2) so also you can do vector<A> v;
v.push_back(34, 45)



(6) perfect forwarding and storing callback for later execution is now fully supported in lambas

auto prepare(Func&& func, Args&&... args) {
  auto f = [funcCopy = std::forward<Func>(func),
            ... argCopies = std::forward<Args>(args)]() mutable {
    return funcCopy(argsCopies...);
  };
  return f;
}

(7) it is possible to compile default comparison operator explicitly
    // either member form
    bool
    operator==(foo const &) const = default;
// ... or friend form
friend bool operator==(foo const &, foo const &) = default;
