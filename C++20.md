# reference_wrapper

now can contains incomplete types !

# ranges

object which contains begin() and end(). They don't replace iterators,but enchance them!

normally ranges return std::ranges::in_out_result which got two members "in" (input iterator - the begin of it) and "out" (begin of output iterator)

The library creates and manipulates range views, lightweight objects that indirectly represent iterable sequences (ranges). Ranges are an abstraction on top of

[begin, end) – iterator pairs, e.g. ranges made by implicit conversion from containers. All algorithms that take iterator pairs now have overloads that accept ranges (e.g. ranges::sort)
begin + [​0​, size) – counted sequences, e.g. range returned by views::counted
[begin, predicate) – conditionally-terminated sequences, e.g. range returned by views::take_while
[begin, ..) – unbounded sequences, e.g. range returned by views::iota
The ranges library includes range algorithms, which are applied to ranges eagerly, and range adaptors, which are applied to views lazily. Adaptors can be composed into pipelines, so that their actions take place as the view is iterated.

## current issues and proposals

https://brevzin.github.io/cpp_proposals/2011_pipeline/d2011r2.html


## IMPORTAT caveates

- Ranges must be passed by value or by forwarding reference!!!!! Otherwise you may get UB - just because some ranges modify values and some other ranges do some internal caching

- IMPORTANT ! In general, it is always valid to modify the elements of any particular view except few exceptions like fitler_view

## how range view piping works!

So looking at this example
auto last = v | std::views::drop(1);

that "std::views::drop" is basically this 

```
 struct _Drop : __adaptor::_RangeAdaptor<_Drop>
    {
      template<viewable_range _Range, typename _Tp>
	requires __detail::__can_drop_view<_Range, _Tp>
	constexpr auto
	operator()(_Range&& __r, _Tp&& __n) const
	{
	 (4) return drop_view(std::forward<_Range>(__r), std::forward<_Tp>(__n));
	}
```

now **__adaptor::_RangeAdaptor** got the following operator function primarely which gets invoked first

```
  template<typename _Derived>
    struct _RangeAdaptor
    {
      template<typename... _Args>
	requires __adaptor_partial_app_viable<_Derived, _Args...>
	constexpr auto
	operator()(_Args&&... __args) const
	{
	(1)  return _Partial<_Derived, decay_t<_Args>...>{std::forward<_Args>(__args)...};
	}
    };
```
**_Partial** is defined as 

```
  template<typename _Adaptor, typename _Arg>
    requires __adaptor_has_simple_extra_args<_Adaptor, _Arg>
      && is_trivially_copyable_v<_Arg>
    struct _Partial<_Adaptor, _Arg> : _RangeAdaptorClosure
    {
      _Arg _M_arg;

      constexpr
      _Partial(_Arg __arg)
	: _M_arg(std::move(__arg))
      { }

      template<typename _Range>
	requires __adaptor_invocable<_Adaptor, _Range, const _Arg&>
	constexpr auto
	operator()(_Range&& __r) const
	(3) { return _Adaptor{}(std::forward<_Range>(__r), _M_arg); } //_Adaptor is (Drop_)

      static constexpr bool _S_has_simple_call_op = true;
    };
```
**_RangeAdaptorClosure** defined as 

```
  struct _RangeAdaptorClosure**
  {
    // range | adaptor is equivalent to adaptor(range).
    template<typename _Self, typename _Range>
      requires derived_from<remove_cvref_t<_Self>, _RangeAdaptorClosure>
	&& __adaptor_invocable<_Self, _Range>
      friend constexpr auto
      operator|(_Range&& __r, _Self&& __self) (--->v (Range) | Partial_<vies::filter::drop>(Self)  <----)
   (2)   { return std::forward<_Self>(__self)(std::forward<_Range>(__r)); }

    // Compose the adaptors __lhs and __rhs into a pipeline, returning
    // another range adaptor closure object.
    template<typename _Lhs, typename _Rhs>
      requires derived_from<_Lhs, _RangeAdaptorClosure>
	&& derived_from<_Rhs, _RangeAdaptorClosure>
      friend constexpr auto
      operator|(_Lhs __lhs, _Rhs __rhs)
      { return _Pipe<_Lhs, _Rhs>{std::move(__lhs), std::move(__rhs)}; }
  };
```

in the end **drop_view** is created which would contain the Range adapted with ranges::all view adapter. In our case it would convert std::vecgor into ranges::ref_view

     drop_view(_Vp __base, range_difference_t<_Vp> __count)
	: _M_count(__count), _M_base(std::move(__base))
      { __glibcxx_assert(__count >= 0); }


## now all range view algorthms support pipes!

operator| is only provided for those algorithms for which the first argument is a range and the result is a range.

transform, filter, take, etc., are all algorithms that take a range and return a range. More specifically, they take a viewable_range and return a view.

But for all the other algorithms - max, find_if, any_of, etc. - that don't return a range, there is no | alternative to them. So this:

```
    original
        | std::ranges::views::transform([](char c){return std::toupper(c);})
        | std::ranges::copy(std::back_inserter(upper));
```

isn't even intended to work, because copy is not one of the algorithms that returns a view, so it doesn't get | support


## rvalues to algorithms

Forbidding all uses of rvalue containers would make the above a compile error, forcing you to create a variable to hold the result of get_vector() before passing that to copy(). This seems overly heavy-handed – after all, the problem is not with the use of rvalue ranges per se, but with returning iterators into such ranges that people might later try to use.

The solution in C++20 is to have a special type, std::ranges::dangling, which algorithms use in their return types instead of potentially-dangling iterators when passed an rvalue range. So for example

auto vec = get_vector();
auto it = std::ranges::find(vec, 99);
is fine – it will be a std::vector::iterator. But if you were to write

auto it = std::ranges::find(get_vector(), 99);
then the code will still compile, but it is now of type std::ranges::dangling

IMPORTANT ! But for algorithms which don't return iterators, taking rvalues is completely fine!

## borrowed ranges


This is not the case for all ranges though. A std::string_view’s iterators for example actually point into some other character array – so we can safely use a string_view::iterator after the string_view itself has been destroyed (provided the underlying array is still around, of course):

std::string str = "Hello world";
// Weird, but okay:
auto iter = std::string_view{str}.begin();
*iter = 'h';
Types like std::string_view are called borrowed ranges in the new C++20 terminology. A borrowed range is one whose iterators can safely outlive their parent object. So an rvalue std::vector is not a borrowed range, but an rvalue std::span is.

Since we don’t need to worry about dangling iterators when we use borrowed ranges, we don’t need to apply the “dangling protection” described above when we pass them as rvalues to algorithms; we can just return iterators as normal:

auto iter = std::ranges::min_element(get_span());
// iter is an iterator, *not* ranges::dangling

auto vec = get_vector();


### Code example

```
auto v1 = vec | views::transform(func);
// Okay: vec is an lvalue
auto v2 = get_span() | views::transform(func);
// Okay: span is borrowed
auto v3 = subrange(vec.begin(), vec.end()) | views::transform(func)
// Okay: subrange is borrowed (and a view)
auto v4 = get_vector() | views::transform(func);
// ERROR: get_vector() returns an rvalue vector, which is neither
// a view nor a borrowed range

```

## sentinels

end() in a range is not necesserialy must be of the same iterator type as begin! it could be any type that got a comparison operator defined

unreachable_sentinel_t is used for optimization to ensure that any comparions would return false so that one can you use range algo which WOULD NEVER REACH the END and "iterator" with end() comparison could be optimized out!

std::ranges::find(s, std::unreachable_sentinel, CharT{})


## std::ranges::views::iota

 A range factory that generates a sequence of elements by repeatedly incrementing an initial value. Can be either bounded or unbounded (infinite)

```
  for (int i : std::ranges::iota_view{1, 10})
        std::cout << i << ' ';
    std::cout << '\n';
 
    for (int i : std::views::iota(1, 10))
        std::cout << i << ' ';
    std::cout << '\n';
```


## common ranges

you can make container out of them!

```
std::vector v(std::ranges::begin(r), std::ranges::end(r));
```
There are the STL containers, for which begin() and end() both return iterators of the same type. We call such a range a “common range”. If r is a common range, the above code will work.

## std::ranges::ref_view

    const std::string s{"cosmos"}; 
    const std::ranges::take_view tv{s, 3};
    const std::ranges::ref_view rv{tv};p

## convert range to standard container

* you can make container out of them!

```
std::vector v(std::ranges::begin(r), std::ranges::end(r));
```
There are the STL containers, for which begin() and end() both return iterators of the same type. We call such a range a “common range”. If r is a common range, the above code will work.



 * However, for all the new C++20 views, begin() returns an iterator and end() returns a sentinel. In general, those are different types. If you give the constructor of std::vector an iterator pair where the types don’t match, it will be all confused and fail to compile.

At first, it might look like we can fix this. There is a view in C++20 that lets you convert a non-common range into a common range. It’s called the common view. The adapter std::views::common returns the common view of a range, if it is not a common range already, and the all view of the range otherwise:

auto common = std::views::common(r);
auto v = std::vector(std::ranges::begin(common), std::ranges::end(common));
Unfortunately, this still doesn’t work for all ranges. Ranges with non-copyable iterators, such as std::ranges::basic_istream_view, cannot be converted to a common range (this is a constraint of common_view). In this case, this approach doesn’t work at all.



* Last resort which would finally work

So let’s try another approach. We can default-initialise the container first (which means you won’t get to benefit from CTAD), and then you explicitly copy the elements of the range across:

```
std::vector<my_type> v;
std::ranges::copy(r, std::back_inserter(v));
```


* Another summary of this issue which would be formally addressed in C++23


## projections

projection is a unary callable that is accepted by the most algorithms. projections modify the view of the data that projection sees. They are invocable really so you can pass pointers to memebers and pointers to member functions!

IMPORTANT: sometimes passing lambdas may be faster than passing pointers to memebers / functions, just because compliers more effectively inline lambads!

## views

IMPORTANT ! In general, it is always valid to modify the elements of any particular view 

enable to create ranges using lazy evaluation and don't create exessive copying / moves!


template<class T>
concept view = ranges::range<T> && std::movable<T> && ranges::enable_view<T>;


1) T models view only if:
move construction of T has constant time complexity, and if N copies and/or moves are made from a T object holding 
M elements, then these N objects have O(N+M) destruction (which implies that a moved-from view object has O(1) destruction), and
either std::copy_constructible<T> is false, or copy construction of T has constant time complexity, and
either std::copyable<T> is false, or copy assignment of T has no more time complexity than destruction followed by copy construction.

Examples of view types are:
-----------------------------
A range type that wraps a pair of iterators, e.g., std::ranges::subrange<I>.
A range type that holds its elements by std::shared_ptr and shares ownership with all its copies.
A range type that generates its elements on demand, e.g., std::ranges::iota_view.
A copyable container such as std::vector<std::string> generally does not meet the semantic requirements of view since copying the container copies all of the elements, which cannot be done in constant time.

While views were originally described as cheaply copyable and non-owning ranges, a type is not required to be copyable or non-owning for it to model view. However, it must still be cheap to copy (if it is copyable), move, assign, and destroy, so that range adaptors will not have unexpected complexity.

By default, a type modeling movable and range is considered a view if it is publicly and unambiguously derived from view_base, or exactly one specialization of std::ranges::view_interface.

### std::views::all

A RangeAdaptorObject (also a RangeAdaptorClosureObject) that returns a view that includes all elements of its range argument.
 - Given an expression e of type R, the expression views::all(e) is expression-equivalent to:
   Implicitly converting e to a std::decay_t<R> prvalue, if std::decay_t<R> models view.
- Otherwise, std::ranges::ref_view{e} if that expression is well-formed.
- Otherwise, std::ranges::owning_view{e}.

### iconic example

```
auto square = [](auto i) { return i* i;};
auto is_even = [](auto i) { return i % 2 == 0;};

auto view = vec | view::filter(is_even)
                | view::transform(square);

reanges::copy(view, ostream_iterator<int>{cout});
```


### filter_view DETAILS

Modification of the element a filter_­view​::​iterator denotes is permitted, but results in undefined behavior if the resulting value does not satisfy the filter predicate!

Also it caches the first begin() so that you must be carefull to re-run the view again!

drop_view, drop_while_view, split_view, reverse_view, and C++23's chunk_by_view.

## range adaptors

they create views from ranges or combine mutliple views into one


## running vies IN-PLACE - SUPPER IMPORTANT & EFFICIENT!

```
   std::vector<int> v{1, 1, 2, 4};
   std::vector<int> v2;
   auto square = [](auto i) { return i * i; };
   auto is_even = [](auto i) { return i % 2 == 0; };
   auto view = v | std::views::filter(is_even) | std::views::transform(square);
   auto r = std::ranges::transform(view, v.begin(), std::identity{}, {});
```

## examples

```
  std::ranges::for_each(v, [](auto v) {}, &Employe::id);
```


```
std::ranges::sort(employes, {}/*ranges_less by default*/, &Empliyed::id)
std::ranges::sort(paycheck, {}/*ranges_less by default*/, &Paycheck::id)
std::ranges::equalt_to(emplolyes, paycheck, {}/*ranges_equal by default*/, &Empliyed::id, &Paycheck::id)
```

# variant

The class template std::variant represents a type-safe union. An instance of std::variant at any given time either holds a value of one of its alternative types, or in the case of error - no value (this state is hard to achieve, see valueless_by_exception).

As with unions, if a variant holds a value of some object type T, the object representation of T is allocated directly within the object representation of the variant itself. Variant is not allowed to allocate additional (dynamic) memory.

A variant is not permitted to hold references, arrays, or the type void. Empty variants are also ill-formed (std::variant<std::monostate> can be used instead).

A variant is permitted to hold the same type more than once, and to hold differently cv-qualified versions of the same type.

Consistent with the behavior of unions during aggregate initialization, a default-constructed variant holds a value of its first alternative, unless that alternative is not default-constructible (in which case the variant is not default-constructible either). The helper class std::monostate can be used to make such variants default-constructible.

## vs virtual functions / inherentence

it is faster for two reasons:

- the variant version doesn’t use dynamic memory allocation, so all the particles are in the same memory block. CPUs can leverage this to get better performance.
- visitor can be inlined fully! so no need to call a function...

## holds_alternative


template< class T, class... Types >
constexpr bool holds_alternative( const std::variant<Types...>& v ) noexcept;
(since C++17)
Checks if the variant v holds the alternative T. The call is ill-formed if T does not appear exactly once in Types.


## valueless_by_exception

constexpr bool valueless_by_exception() const noexcept;

A variant may become valueless in the following situations:

(guaranteed) an exception is thrown during the initialization of the contained value during move assignment
(optionally) an exception is thrown during the initialization of the contained value during copy assignment
(optionally) an exception is thrown when initializing the contained value during a type-changing assignment
(optionally) an exception is thrown when initializing the contained value during a type-changing emplace
Since variant is never permitted to allocate dynamic memory, previous value cannot be retained in these situations. The situations marked "optionally" can be worked around by implementations that first construct the new value on the stack and then move it into the variant (provided non-throwing move).

This applies even to variants of non-class types:

struct S {
    operator int() { throw 42; }
};

std::variant<float, int> v{12.f}; // OK
v.emplace<1>(S()); // v may be valueless
A variant that is valueless by exception is treated as being in an invalid state: index returns variant_npos, get and visit throw bad_variant_access.

# std::span

The class template span describes an object that can refer to a contiguous sequence of objects with the first element of the sequence at position zero. A span can either have a static extent, in which case the number of elements in the sequence is known at compile-time and encoded in the type, or a dynamic extent. Span is both range and a VIEW!

If a span has dynamic extent, a typical implementation holds two members: a pointer to T and a size. A span with static extent may have only one member: a pointer to T

 std::span has no comparison operators

# concepts

 * Non-formal definition -> Concept allows us to control the instantiation of templates by testing syntactic conditions, but testing syntactic conditions. SFINAE on steroids

 * A concept is a named set of requirements.The definition of a   concept must appear at namespace scope   concepts are like compile time predicate
  and farily the same can be said about constraints,  but concepts emobyd semantics(meaning).
  Each concept is a predicate, evaluated at compile time, and becomes a part of the interface of a template where it is used as a constraint.

 * Violations of constraints are detected at compile time, early in the template instantiation process,
  which leads to easy to follow error message. The intent of concepts is to model semantic categories(Number, Range, RegularFunction)
   rather than syntactic restrictions(HasPlus, Array) - The ability to specify a
    meaningful semantics is a defining characteristic of a true concept,
    as opposed to a syntactic constrain

    Say Sorteable is concept,
    but constraint is say Subtractable,
    Incrementable

    // Concepts cannot recursively refer to themselves and cannot be constrained
    template <class T, class U>
    concept Derived = std::is_base_of<U, T>::value;
template <typename T>
concept Hashable = requires(T a) {
  { std::hash<T>{}(a) } -> std::convertible_to<std::size_t>;
};

template <C1 T>
concept Error1 = true; // Error: C1 T attempts to constrain a concept definition
template <class T>
requires C1<T>
concept Error2 =
    true; // Error: the requires-clause attempts to constrain a concept

Explicit instantiations, explicit specializations,
    or partial specializations of concepts
                are not allowed(the meaning of the original definition of a
                                    constraint cannot be changed)
                    .

            ................

            The keyword requires is used to introduce a requires -
            clause,
    which specifies constraints on template arguments or
        on a function declaration

            the keyword requires must be followed by some constant
            expression(so its possible to write requires true), but the intent is that a named concept (as in the example above) or a conjunction/disjunction of named concepts or a requires-expression is used



 * Concepts can be part of template
```
  template <Addable T>
  void f(const T& t) {  
  }
```

 * Concepts can be just used with auto
```
auto f(Addable cont auto const& v) {
}
```

* Concep can be just defined as simple exprssions as well
```
 template< class T, class... Args >
concept constructible_from =
    std::destructible<T> && std::is_constructible_v<T, Args...>;
```

* Concept can be composed in a pretty complicated way
```        
template< class I >
    concept bidirectional_iterator =
        std::forward_iterator<I> &&
        std::derived_from</*ITER_CONCEPT*/<I>, std::bidirectional_iterator_tag> &&
        requires(I i) {
            { --i } -> std::same_as<I&>;
            { i-- } -> std::same_as<I>;
        };
```

## constraint 

 constraint is a sequence of logical operations and operands that specifies requirements on template arguments. They can appear within requires-expressions (see below) and directly as bodies of concepts.
There are three types of constraints:

1) conjunctions
2) disjunctions
3) atomic constraints

The keyword requires is used to introduce a requires-clause, which specifies constraints on template arguments or on a function declaration
template<class T>
void g(T) requires is_purrable<T>(); // error, is_purrable<T>() is not a primary expression
template <class T> void h(T) requires(is_purrable<T>()); // OK

The keyword requires is also used to begin a requires - expression,
which is a prvalue expression of type bool that describes the constraints on
some template arguments.Such an expression is true if the constraints are satisfied,and false otherwise

```
 template <typename T>
    concept Addable = requires(T x) {
  x + x;
}; // requires-expression
```

template <typename T>
requires Addable<T> // requires-clause, not requires-expression
    T add(T a, T b) {
  return a + b;
}

template <typename T>
requires requires(T x) { x + x; } // ad-hoc constraint, note keyword used twice
T add(T a, T b) { return a + b; }

Concepts works really well with lambdas !template <class T>
concept Number = std::is_integer<T>::value;
auto f = [](Number n)

    // infamous `requires requires`. First `requires` is requires-clause,
    // second one is requires-expression. Useful if you don't want to introduce
    // new concept.
    template <typename T>
requires requires(T a, T b) { a + b; }
auto f4(T x)


...............

 For parameter packs, MyConcept... Ts requires MyConcept to be true for each element of the pack, not for the whole pack at once, e.g. requires<T1> && requires<T2> && ... && requires<TLast>.


 ..............
 Contstrains can be used for function overload basically, but one thing is important to note
 
 It’s important to understand how the compiler decomposes constraints and when it can see that they have common atomic constraint and deduce order between them. During decomposition, the concept name is replaced with its definition but requires-expression is not further decomposed. Two atomic constraints are identical only if they are represented by the same expression at the same location. For example, concept C = C1 && C2 is decomposed to conjunction of C1 and C2 but concept C = requires{
  ...
} becomes concept C = Expression-Location-Pair and its body is not further decomposed. If two concepts have common or even the same requirements in their requires-expression, they will always be unordered because either their requires-expressions are not equal or they are equal but at different source locations. The same happens with duplicated usage of a naked type traits - they always represent different atomic constraints because of different locations, thus, cannot be used for orderin

void f(std::integral auto){}        // #1
void f(integral_or_floating auto) {} // #2
void f(std::same_as<char> auto) {}   // #3

// calls #1 because std::integral is more constrained
// than integral_or_floating(#2)
f(int{});

(4) C++ 17 didn’t allow to move rvalue references in return statements,
    function parameters in throw expressions,
    and various forms of conversions unreasonably prevented moving

    (5) std::launder is
    not requried anymore as const andr ref now can be repalced in placement new

    (5) c++ 20 now allows you to do this;
->unofficially called direct aggregate initialization

    struct A {
  int i;
  int b;
};

A a(1, 2) so also you can do vector<A> v;
v.push_back(34, 45)



(6) perfect forwarding and storing callback for later execution is now fully supported in lambas

auto prepare(Func&& func, Args&&... args) {
  auto f = [funcCopy = std::forward<Func>(func),
            ... argCopies = std::forward<Args>(args)]() mutable {
    return funcCopy(argsCopies...);
  };
  return f;
}

(7) it is possible to compile default comparison operator explicitly
    // either member form
    bool
    operator==(foo const &) const = default;
// ... or friend form
friend bool operator==(foo const &, foo const &) = default;


# std::format

std::cout << std::format("Hello {}!\n", "world");
