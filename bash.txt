-----------------------------------
Some people have a habit of doing things like

for line in $(cat file); do ...; done
Since the shell will have to expand the $(cat file) command substitution completely before running the for loop, this will read the whole of file into memory (that of the shell executing the for loop). This is a bit silly. Instead, one should do

while read -r line; do ...; done <file
This will process file line by line (but do read Understanding "IFS= read -r line").
