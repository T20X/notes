-----------------------------------
Some people have a habit of doing things like

for line in $(cat file); do ...; done
Since the shell will have to expand the $(cat file) command substitution completely before running the for loop, this will read the whole of file into memory (that of the shell executing the for loop). This is a bit silly. Instead, one should do

while read -r line; do ...; done <file
This will process file line by line (but do read Understanding "IFS= read -r line").

----------

sudo apt-cache policy openssl
sudo apt-get install package=version

----
shared libraries can be configured at /etc/ld.so.conf.d
so no LD_LIBRARY_PATH is required


-------
e.g sudo nano /etc/netplan/02-netcfg.yaml

Enter the following to configure a static IP of 192.168.56.12 where enp0s3 is the name of your host-only adapter.

network:
    version: 2
    renderer: networkd
    ethernets:
        enp0s3:
            addresses:
                - 192.168.56.12/24
            dhcp4: no
Then run the following two commands:

sudo netplan generate
sudo netplan apply

------
# /sbin/ifconfig <interface> up
# /sbin/ifconfig <interface> down
