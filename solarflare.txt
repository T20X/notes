1. The Solarflare SFN7000, SFN8000 and X2 series adapters support multicast
replication where received packets are replicated in hardware and delivered to
multiple receive queues


2. If a multicaststream is being accelerated by Onload, and another application that is
not using Onload subscribes to the same stream, then the second application will
not receive the associated datagrams. Therefore if multiple applications subscribe
to a particular multicast stream, either all or none should be run with Onload.


3. When multiple sockets join the same multicast group, received packets are
delivered to these sockets in the order that they joined the group.
When multiple sockets are created by different threads and all threads are spinning
on recv(), the thread which is able to receive first will also deliver the packets to
the other sockets.
If a thread ‘A’ is spinning on poll(), and another thread ‘B’, listening to the same
group, calls recv() but does not spin, ‘A’ will notice a received packet first and
deliver the packet to ‘B’ without an interrupt occurring
