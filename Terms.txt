open/closed principle of the software design—a class (or another unit of code, such as a module) should be closed for modifications; once the class presents an interface to its clients, the clients come to depend on this interface and the functionality it provides
--------------
virtual function - enables overriding implementation of a function in the derived class by calling it from the base class interface
------------------
Next time somebody tells you that you should never use multiple inheritance, look them straight in the eye and say, �One size does not fit all.� If they respond with something about their bad experience on their project, look them in the eye and repeat, slower this time, �One size does not fit all.�
---------------------
An object's class defines how the object is implemented .The class defines object's internal state and the implementation of its operations.

In contrast, an object's type only refers to its interface - a set of requests to which it can respond.
An object can have many types, and objects of different classes can have the same type.

------------
An object, in C++, is a region of storage that has

- size (can be determined with sizeof);
- alignment requirement (can be determined with alignof);
- storage duration (automatic, static, dynamic, thread-local);
- lifetime (bounded by storage duration or temporary);
type;
- value (which may be indeterminate, e.g. for default-initialized non-class types);
optionally, a name.
----------------
closure: an unnamed function object capable of capturing variables in scope
------------------
an object is a storage where value lives
-------------
An entity is a value, object, reference, structured binding, function, enumerator, type, class member, bit-field, template, template specialization, namespace, or pack

Every name that denotes an entity is introduced by a declaration
-------------
An expression is a sequence of operators and operands that specifies a computation. An expression can result in a value and can cause side effects
------------------
The object representation of an object of type T is the sequence of N unsigned char objects taken up by the object of type T, where N equals sizeof(T). The value representation of an object of type T is the set of bits that participate in representing a value of type T. Bits in the object representation that are not part of the value representation are padding bits
------------
An object type is a (possibly cv-qualified) type that is not a function type, not a reference type, and not cv void.
-------------------------------
Operators can be overloaded, that is, given meaning when applied to expressions of class type or enumeration type
-----------------------
Segment
a logically contiguous chunk of memory with consistent properties (CPU's speaking)
Segment Register
a register of your CPU that refers to a segment for a special use (e.g. SS, CS, DS ...)
Selector
a reference to a descriptor you can load into a segment register; the selector is an offset of a descriptor table entry. These entries are 8 bytes long. Therefore, bits 3 and up only declare the descriptor table entry offset, while bit 2 specifies if this selector is a GDT or LDT selector (LDT - bit set, GDT - bit cleared), and bits 0 - 1 declare the ring level that needs to correspond to the descriptor table entry's DPL field. If it doesn't, a General Protection Fault occurs; if it does correspond then the CPL level of the selector used is changed accordingly.
Descriptor
a memory structure (part of a table) that tells the CPU the attributes of a given segment

-------
idempotency - In computing, an idempotent operation is one that has no additional effect if it is called more than once with the same input parameters
