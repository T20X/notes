NIC errros
-------
overruns - not enogh space in ring buffers
dropped - not enough space in buffers TCP/UDP.
errors - ill-formed packets

RoCE stands for RDMA over Converged Ethernet. It is a standard that enables
 passing RDMA traffic over an Ethernet network.

FCoE - Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) is a computer network technology that encapsulates Fibre Channel frames 
over Ethernet network

tcp_window_scaling (Boolean; default: enabled; since Linux 2.2)
              Enable  RFC 1323  TCP  window  scaling.   This feature allows the use of a large window (> 64 kB) on a TCP connection, should the other end support it

tcp_fin_timeout (integer; default: 60; since Linux 2.2)
              This specifies how many seconds to wait for a final FIN packet before the socket is forcibly closed.  This is strictly a violation of  the  TCP  specification,  but  required  to  prevent
              denial-of-service attacks.  In Linux 2.2, the default value was 180


tcp_mem [low,pressure,limit] - in PAGES!
 low - no regulation for memory allocation!
 pressure - starts to regulate buffer memory allocation!
 limit - no more allocation!This value overrides any other limits imposed by the kernel

        tcp_retries1 (integer; default: 3; since Linux 2.2)
              The number of times TCP will attempt to retransmit a packet on an established connection normally, without the extra effort of getting the network layers involved.  Once  we  exceed  this
              number of retransmits, we first have the network layer update the route if possible before each new retransmit.  The default is the RFC specified minimum of 3.

       tcp_retries2 (integer; default: 15; since Linux 2.2)
              The  maximum  number of times a TCP packet is retransmitted in established state before giving up.  The default value is 15, which corresponds to a duration of approximately between 13 to
              30 minutes, depending on the retransmission timeout.  The RFC 1122 specified minimum limit of 100 seconds is typically deemed too short.

TCP Segmentation offload - These days many NICs can create headers/checksum for a given user data autmatically given a template from kernel! this can save massive amount of CPU time.

TCP_CORK aggressively accumulates data. If TCP_CORK is enabled in a socket, it will not send data until the buffer fills to a fixed limit (MSS size). But still up until 200ms  - then it will be sent anyway!
