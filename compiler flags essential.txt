-fuse-cxa-atexit
----------------
 Register destructors for objects with static storage duration with the __cxa_atexit  function rather than the atexit function. This option is required for fully standards- compliant handling of static destructors, but only works if your C library supports  __cxa_atexit. Normal atexit does not handle shared library unloading and has limit of  32 calls!

 -ftime-report
 --------
 provide hunderds of paramters containing how much each step of the build took!

 ------
 -mregnames - shows registers in asm output


 ----

 -rdynamic
Pass the flag -export-dynamic to the ELF linker, on targets that support it. This instructs the linker to add all symbols, not only used ones, to the dynamic symbol table. This option is needed for some uses of dlopen or to allow obtaining backtraces from within a program.
