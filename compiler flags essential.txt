-fuse-cxa-atexit
----------------
 Register destructors for objects with static storage duration with the __cxa_atexit  function rather than the atexit function. This option is required for fully standards- compliant handling of static destructors, but only works if your C library supports  __cxa_atexit. Normal atexit does not handle shared library unloading and has limit of  32 calls!

 -ftime-report
 --------
 provide hunderds of paramters containing how much each step of the build took!

 -mregnames - shows registers in asm output
