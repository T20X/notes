fast glykoletichskie volokna - mnogo glycogena, grow fast and have lots of power. can generate lots of energy from glycok using anaerobic (without air) 

-----------
slow (red) volokna - mnogo mitohondriy, grow slow but can anerobically (with air) produce energy (ATF) for long time. they also can make energy from pervate(molochnaya kislota)

fast volokna have 3x more power then slow ones
statodinamica only works when there is enough fast volknovs developed which given to us by nature

insulin enables glycose to be absorbed by cells and also controls sugar levels. It is releases if sugar levels in the blood rises.
--------
glucagon is another hormone which enables sugar(glycongen) to be released from the liver if the sugar levels in the blood are too low
