---------------
STRUCTUREDED BINDINGS
----------------
std::map myMap;    
for (const auto & [k,v] : myMap) 
{ // k - key   // v - value }
}

auto& [ refA, refB, refC, refD ] = myTuple;
auto [a, b] = myPair;

EVENT STRUCTS!
struct S { int x1 : 2; volatile double y1; };
S f();
const auto [ x, y ] = f();

---------------------
2. NEW IF STATEMENT
----------------
if (auto val = GetValue(); condition(val))    
    // on success  
else   
    // on false... 
val is visible only inside the if and else statements, so it doesn't 'leak

----------------
3. INLINE VARIABLES
----------------

-----------
4. THIS BY VALUE
------
This can now be copied instead of using this pointer! Note that class copy 
constructor would be called
  auto f1 = [*this](){}

-----------
5. std::raw_storage_iterator
-------------

----------------
6. pointers
---------------
integer represention of a pointer might not be the same but sequence  as the pointer itself

 it is ok to convert a pointer to integer and then integer back to pointer. But modifying that integer in the middle is kind of on the endge according to c++ standarrt!

7. Since C++17, the evaluation order of operands of operator << is strictly from left to right, and operands of overloaded operator share the same evaluation order as those of the bulit-in one
  Postfix expressions are evaluated from left to right. This includes functions calls and member
selection expressions.
? Assignment expressions are evaluated from right to left. This includes compound assignments.
? Operands to shift operators are evaluated from left to righ

All side effects of argument evaluations are sequenced before the function is entered

8. template <auto value> void f() { }

f<10>();               // deduces int

9. Pack expansions in using declarations - short and compact syntax with variadic templates

template<class... Ts> struct overload : Ts... { using Ts::operator()...; };
template<class... Ts> overload(Ts...) -> overload<Ts...>;
std::variant<int, float> intFloat { 0.0f };
std::visit(overload(
    [](const int& i) { ... },
    [](const float& f) { ... },
  ),
  intFloat;
);

Pack expansions in using declarations - short and compact syntax with variadic templates.
Custom template argument deduction rules - that allows converting a list of lambdas into a list of base classes for the overloaded class.
Extension to aggregate Initialization - the overload pattern uses a constructor to initialise, but we don�t have to specify it in the class. Before C++17 it wasn�t possible


10. Aggregate initialization for base classes is now possible!
struct A0 {  A0(int) {}};
struct A : A0 {  A(int):A0(1) {} };
struct B {   B(int){} };
struct D : A, B {};
 D d1{1,2}; //WORKS NOW in C++17!

11.  constexpr lambdas do work now!
12. in C++ now prvalues(values not having a name) are defined now. Bascially this
auto x = T(); x will get constructed like T()! Even if copy constructor for T is deleted!

13.
void transmogrify(std::vector<C>& out) 
{ fill out...}

in c++17 out can be returned by value as copy ellison is now guaranteed

14. template <auto v> struct S;                 // type of v is deduced
    template <auto x> constexpr auto constant = x;
    // List of heterogeneous constant values
  // same as template <auto v1, auto v2, auto v3, ...>
  template <auto... vs> struct value_list { };

  // List of homogeneous constant values
template <auto v1, decltype(v1)... vs> struct typed_value_list { };


15. auto for non template type parameter

template <auto func>
auto make_lambda();
You could use it like this:

bool foo(int);
auto lambda = make_lambda<foo>();

# copy ellision

since copy ellision has been added to c++17, the following is possible now.

std::mutex make() {
  return std::mutex{};
}

std::mutex m = make();

# pointer value

But in the C++17 standard added a new quality to a pointer value. This quality is not encode within the pointer type but qualifies directly the value, independently of the type (this is the case also of the traceability). It is described in [basic.compound]/3

Every value of pointer type is one of the following:

- a pointer to an object or function (the pointer is said to point to the object or function), or
- a pointer past the end of an object ([expr.add]), or
- the null pointer value for that type, or an invalid pointer value.
