1. "is connected to " is a equivalance relation.
   Reflexive: p is connected to p
   Symmetric: if p is connected to q then q is connected to p
   Transitive: if p is connected to q and q is connected to z then p is connected to z

2. when proving by induction the induction step must be proved in exact form as induction hypotesis!

for example

T(n) = 2*T(n/2) + n,
Let's assume that T(n) <= O(n) for O(n) = cn for some constant c > 0
then T(n) <= 2*c*n/2 + n = c*n + (n)/*wrong this is much higher than in the exact induction hypotesys form!

when proving by induction you may move the boundury conditions. Say instead of typycally proving boundaries for T(1), can just prove for T(2) and T(3), even though T(1) = d may be used by recursion to get boundary values for T(2) and T(3)
